### [â†‘](#contents) Terraform Deployment Template Setup for Ansible
* This template has been created for the purpose of deploying a Linux VM to Azure, using Terraform Infrastructure as Code to automatically provision an environment to deploy Ansible or Ansible Tower to a Enterprise environment rapidly and in an automated matter. This infrastructure has been written by Sacha Roussakis-Notter you can view more at: [Github](https://github.com/DFW1N/).

### [â†‘](#contents) 1.0 Create a Service Principal with a Client Secret
* Please Review for Hashicorp Guide for Azure Service Principal Authentication
    https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

### [â†‘](#contents) Connecting to Terraform Cloud Remote Backend
* Register an account at : https://app.terraform.io/ [Recommend enabling MFA] > Create Organization > [+ New workspace]
* Ensure, Azure CLI, Powershell & Terraform are installed in Visual Studio Code open Terminal type : 

      terraform login

* Follow terminal prompts and creare a API token to authenticate with copy and paste code to your terminal once authenticated.
* Input backend remote code into your provider.tf file

                        terraform {
                    backend "remote" {
                        organization = "organization-value-name"

                        workspaces {
                        name = "workstation-value-name-you-set"
                        }
                    }
                    } 

### [â†‘](#contents) Configuring the Service Principal in Terraform
* Setting these values into your environment variable allows you to remove them from your code as these are SECRET and should not be shared.
* Once these variables are set restart your terminal and Visual Studio Code to allow it to take effect.

        setx ARM_CLIENT_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_CLIENT_SECRET "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_TENANT_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

* What is Ansible? https://www.ansible.com/
* What is Bash Script? https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php

### [â†‘](#contents) Create a Azure local blob storage account Container for tfstate backend file

* Using Azure Storage Container to store state file instead of remote backend from terraform in code :

        terraform {
          backend "azurerm" {
            resource_group_name  = "Resource-Group-Name-Value"
            storage_account_name = "Account-Name-Value"
            container_name       = "tfstate"
            key                  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
          }
        }

### [â†‘](#contents) Deploy Terraform infrastructure commands

* To deploy Terraform you must change some current values in the files but the main commands to Initialize, Plan, Build & Deploy it to Azure are the following :

      terraform init
      terraform fmt
      terraform plan
      terraform apply
      terraform destroy
 
* Once the infrastructure has been deployed locate the public ip address and connect to the vm through ssh :
        
         ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa adminuser@192.73.20.123

* To prepare Ansible please start following these commands so Ansible can communicate to Azure. Alternatively you can run the ansible-ssh-automation.sh script in the repository.

         mkdir ~/.azure
         
         nano ~/.azure/credentials

* Input Azure Service Principle Values into these below located in the ~/.azure/credentials directory.

        [default]

        subscription_id=<your-Azure-subscription_id>

        client_id=<azure service-principal-appid>

        secret=<azure service-principal-password>

        tenant=<azure serviceprincipal-tenant> 

* You can create your SSH keys using the commands below or by using the ssh shell script in this repository.

      ssh-keygen -t rsa
      chmod 755 ~/.ssh
      touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      ssh-copy-id adminuser@127.0.0.1
      
 * Input account password value
      
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

### [â†‘](#contents) Create SSH Service Connection in Azure DevOps

* Create the Service Connection to allow SSH Connection and push Ansible Playbooks to the Virtual Machine
    
1. https://dev.azure.com/ > Project > Project Settings > Service Connections > Select : New Service Connection > Select : SSH
    
2. Add SSH Service Connection > Input Values : Public IP, Username, Password, id_rsa you cat eariler > OK.

### [â†‘](#contents) Run the Shell Scripts

### [â†‘](#contents) Push Configurations to Remote Virtual Machines from Main Ansible Node Connector

* Follow the SSH requirements above and do the following : 

      ssh-copy-id {admin_user}@{Remote_VM_IP} //Example: ssh-copy-id root@192.70.109.15
    
* Input host password hit enter to add the public key you can now authenticate without being requested for a password.
* Define your remote hosts through the following file : 

      vim /etc/ansible/hosts > [webservers]
                               {remote host IP address}
                               {//Example 192.70.109.15}

      sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars && sudo nano /etc/ansible/group_vars/servers
      
* Input the following : 

               ----------------------------------------
                        ansible_user: root
               ----------------------------------------


* Test remote host by pinging from ansible with the following command :

### [â†‘](#contents) Notes 
* Ansible Tower only support Ubuntu Linux until version 16.04
* If you deploy my ansible-autosetup.sh bash script it will automatically give ansible-ssh-automation.sh the correct permissions to start the SSH process.
* Ansible Tower does not offer support to Ubuntu version 18 or 19.
* Ansible Tower Default Username : admin
* Use command : terraform fmt | To Fix spacing in your code.
