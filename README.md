### [â†‘](#contents) Introduction

Terraform automation to create a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 and using custom bash scripts to automate the setup for ansible to control and push configurations to remote hosts on Microsoft Azure.

#### Ansible Glossary:
The following Ansible-specific terms that are used throughout this guide include the following:

* Inventory File: a file that contains information about the servers Ansible controls, typically located at /etc/ansible/hosts.
* Playbook: a file containing a series of tasks to be executed on a remote server.
* Remote Host/Node: a server controlled by the Ansible server.
* Ansible Server: a system where Ansible is installed and configured to connect and execute commands on remote hosts/nodes.

* What is Ansible? https://www.ansible.com/
* What is Bash Script? https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php

### [â†‘](#contents) Terraform Deployment Template Setup for Ansible
* This template has been created for the purpose of deploying a Linux VM to Azure, using Terraform Infrastructure as Code to automatically provision an environment to deploy Ansible or Ansible Tower to a Enterprise environment rapidly and in an automated matter.

### [â†‘](#contents) Deploy Terraform infrastructure commands

* Note: You can find the latest Terraform code templates at : https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs
* Templates: You can view Terraform code examples at : https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples

* To deploy Terraform you must change some current values in the files but the main commands to Initialize, Plan, Build & Deploy it to Azure are the following :

      terraform init
      terraform fmt
      terraform plan
      terraform apply
      terraform destroy

    
### [â†‘](#contents) Connecting to Terraform Cloud Remote Backend
* Register an account at : https://app.terraform.io/ [Recommend enabling MFA] > Create Organization > [+ New workspace]
* Ensure, Azure CLI, Powershell & Terraform are installed in Visual Studio Code open Terminal type : 

      terraform login

* Follow terminal prompts and creare a API token to authenticate with copy and paste code to your terminal once authenticated.
* Input backend remote code into your provider.tf file

                        terraform {
                    backend "remote" {
                        organization = "organization-value-name"

                        workspaces {
                        name = "workstation-value-name-you-set"
                        }
                    }
                    } 

* Preview of using local CLI commands using Terraform Cloud :

### [â†‘](#contents) Create a Azure local blob storage account Container for tfstate backend file

* Using Azure Storage Container to store state file instead of remote backend from terraform in code :

        terraform {
          backend "azurerm" {
            resource_group_name  = "Resource-Group-Name-Value"
            storage_account_name = "Account-Name-Value"
            container_name       = "tfstate"
            key                  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
          }
        }

### [â†‘](#contents) Create a Service Principal with a Client Secret
* Please Review for Hashicorp Guide for Azure Service Principal Authentication
    https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

### [â†‘](#contents) Configuring the Service Principal in Terraform
* Setting these values into your environment variable allows you to remove them from your code as these are SECRET and should not be shared.
* Once these variables are set restart your terminal and Visual Studio Code to allow it to take effect.

        setx ARM_CLIENT_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_CLIENT_SECRET "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        setx ARM_TENANT_ID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 
* Once the infrastructure has been deployed locate the public ip address and connect to the vm through ssh :
        
         ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa adminuser@192.73.20.123

### [â†‘](#contents) Create SSH Service Connection in Azure DevOps

* Create the Service Connection to allow SSH Connection and push Ansible Playbooks to the Virtual Machine
    
1. https://dev.azure.com/ > Project > Project Settings > Service Connections > Select : New Service Connection > Select : SSH
    
2. Add SSH Service Connection > Input Values : Public IP, Username, Password, id_rsa you cat eariler > OK.

### [â†‘](#contents) Run the Shell Script

* Git clone my bash script from https://github.com/DFW1N/terraform-ansible-azure
 
        git clone https://github.com/DFW1N/terraform-ansible-azure.git && cd terraform-ansible-azure
        
        sudo chmod +x autosetup.sh
        sudo sh autosetup.sh

### [â†‘](#contents) Ansible Installation on Ubuntu Linux

* Please follow this section if you prefer to not use the shell script to automate the process for you.

#### 1.0: Installing & Updating required packages for Ansible:

      sudo apt-get upgrade -y

#### 2.0: Adding the offical Ansible repository to APT database:

      sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

#### 3.0: Install Ansible:

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install ansible -y
      sudo apt-get install python -y
    
#### 4.0: Verify Ansible Installation Version:

      ansible --version
 
#### 5.0: Create the files to allow Ansible Server to authenticate with Azure: [Azure only]

      mkdir ~/.azure && cd ~/.azure;
      sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFW1N/ansible-tower/main/credentials -o credentials;

* Input Azure Service Principle Values into these below located in the ~/.azure/credentials directory: [Azure only]

        [default]

        subscription_id=<your-Azure-subscription_id>

        client_id=<azure service-principal-appid>

        secret=<azure service-principal-password>

        tenant=<azure serviceprincipal-tenant> 
 
#### 6.0: Lastly generate a SSH key to the Ansible server:
 
      ssh-keygen
      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 
#### 7.0: Copy id_rsa.pub to remote server you want to connect to your Ansible server:

* Option 1 Quick Version: Issue this command from Ansible Server to remote host:

      sudo ssh-copy-id 192.182.16.23

* Password prompt for remote host will pop up input that value to add the ssh id_rsa.pub to remote host.

* Option 2 Longer Version:

      Copy the text from the key
      Log into your node server
      run: sudo -s
      Open the authorized_keys file: sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      Paste the id_rsa.pub key to the file from your Ansible server
      Save and close the file
 
 * Please ensure you are logged in as root to view authorized_keys as it won't be located anywhere else but under the /root/ home directory.
 
#### 8.0: Configure your Ansible files:
Please ensure you are logged in on your Ansible server and configure Ansible files for remote hosts:

      sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
      
* Add your remote servers to this file using the following syntax:

* The following example defines a group named [azureservers] with two different servers in it, each identified by a custom alias: azureserver & azureserver2 remmeber to change the IP address to your remote hosts.

      [azureservers]
      azureserver ansible_host=192.182.16.23
      azureserver2 ansible_host=192.173.34.23

      [all:vars]
      ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

* View your ansible inventory you will see your server infrastructure thats defined in your inventory file on your Ansible server:

      ansible-inventory --list -y

* Output
      
      all:
        children:
          azureservers:
            hosts:
              azureserver:
                ansible_host: 192.182.16.23
                ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              azureserver2:
                ansible_host: 192.173.34.23
                ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3

#### 9.0: Test your Ansible Connection:

* Test remote host by pinging from ansible with the following command : 

      ansible -m ping all

* Expected output response:

      azureserver | SUCCESS => {
          "changed": false, 
          "ping": "pong"
      }
      azureserver2 | SUCCESS => {
      "changed": false, 
      "ping": "pong"
      }
    
* Ping remote hosts defined under your configuration such as [databases] :

      ansible -m ping databases
    
* Check remote system versions :

      ansible -u adminuser -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m raw -a 'uname -a' azureservers

* Check disk usage on all remote servers with:

      ansible all -a "df -h" -u adminuser

### [â†‘](#contents) Configure Ansible to run as a specific user:

* creating a file that instructs all servers to connect as root user : 
   
      sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars && sudo nano /etc/ansible/group_vars/servers
      
* Input the following username used on the remote host: 

       ansible_ssh_user: adminuser

### [â†‘](#contents) Review Ansible Playbooks for Azure

* Playbook: A file containing a series of tasks to be executed on a remote server.
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/ansible-playbooks/ansible-playbooks-for-azure/


### [â†‘](#contents) Ansible Tower Installation on Ubuntu Linux
* Ansible Tower Installation on [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/)
1. Access the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) website and Download the [Ansible Tower product](https://www.ansible.com/products/tower)

* Assumation that the ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz package is located inside the /tmp directory please follow commands in order:

      cd /tmp
      tar -zxvf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz [Ansible Tower Download File]
      cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup{version}
      vi inventory
   
* Inventory file contents:

      [tower]
      localhost ansible_connection=local

      [database]

      [all:vars]
      admin_password=''

      pg_host=''
      pg_port=''

      pg_database='awx'
      pg_username='awx'
      pg_password=''

      rabbitmq_username=tower
      rabbitmq_password=''
      rabbitmq_cookie=cookiemonster

* Isolated Tower nodes automatically generate an RSA key for authentication;
* To disable this behavior, set this value to false
* isolated_key_generation=true
 
### Changing the following values from the inventory file for Ansible Tower:

        admin_password=''
        pg_password=''
        rabbitmq_password=''
        
 * Once values have been changed start Ansible Tower installation process:
 
        cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup{version}
        ./setup.sh
    
 * On completion of installation open browser and enter IP address of your Ansible tower.
    
 * To log in use the 'default' username: admin and input the password you set above under the 
      
        [admin_password='input value']

### [â†‘](#contents) Notes 

* Ansible Tower only support Ubuntu Linux until version 16.04
* If you deploy my ansible-autosetup.sh bash script it will automatically give ansible-ssh-automation.sh the correct permissions to start the SSH process.
* Ansible Tower does not offer support to Ubuntu version 18 or 19.
* Ansible Tower Default Username : admin
* Use command : terraform fmt | To Fix spacing in your code.
